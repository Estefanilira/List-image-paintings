# Development of the "list-image-painting" Project - Mobile-First Solution

## Description:

The "list-image-painting" project is a web application developed with a focus on a "Mobile-First" approach. 
This design and development methodology places the initial emphasis on optimizing for mobile devices and later expands
the layout to accommodate larger devices, ensuring a consistent and effective user experience on any screen.

## Goal:

The goal of this project is to create an interactive and responsive user interface that displays a list of images 
and their details in an elegant and functional way. The main focus is to provide a pleasant and effective experience 
for users who access the application on mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets.


* HTML: The application's content structure is built with HTML (HyperText Markup Language), providing the basis for organizing elements on the page.
* CSS: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to style and position elements, ensuring an attractive and responsive design.
* Mobile-First Design: The "Mobile-First" approach is adopted from the beginning of the project, ensuring that the application is initially designed and tested on mobile devices and then expanded to larger devices if necessary.
